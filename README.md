# MRAM-Thesis

### MRAM - Magnetic Random Access Memory
This project is my engineering thesis code, it allows user to create find optimal cost/time ratio in <b>Magnetic Tunnel Junction</b>
which is basic cell for <b>MRAM</b>. 
Project consists of 3 main directories:
* Core
* C++_core
* PythonVisualisation

### Core
Core directory is place where all core features are kept, this is Thesis main directory, where Makefile could be found.
Inside Core, tests, and all sources could also be found.<br />
Inside Config directory config file can be found, usage is described in my Engineering Thesis.

### C++_core
In early versions of project this was core directory but now is deprecated and used mainly as tests directory

### PythonVisualisation
PythonVisualisation directory consists of code in Python which uses matplotlib to present data
on plots.

Data from Core to PythonVisualisation can be send using OS pipes.
